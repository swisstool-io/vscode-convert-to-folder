Ever typed a name like `api` or `routes`, hit *Enter*, and realized you just created a **file** instead of a **folder**?  
Then you delete it, make a folder, and start over — two steps too many.

**Convert to Folder** fixes that. One small, quiet improvement that makes your workflow smoother.


## ✨ Features

- Converts any file into a folder with the same name  
- If the file has content, it becomes `index` inside the new folder  
- If the file is empty, only the folder is created  
- Works on Linux, macOS and Windows

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. In the **Explorer**, right-click a file.  
2. Choose **“Convert to Folder”**.  
3. The extension will:
   - If the file has **unsaved changes**, it prompts you to save before converting.  
   - If the file has content, it creates a folder and moves the file’s contents into an `index` file.  
   - If the file is empty, it simply creates an empty folder.

**Command:**  
`convertToFolder.convert`

You can also run it from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `⇧⌘P`).
